================ END-OF-SESSION SUMMARY =================

Date: 2025-11-23
Precision Mode Status: ON (default, no user override)
Session Revision: Rev 1
Builds on: N/A
Overall Reliability Status: Fully Reliable
Reason for Reliability Status: Session content sourced directly from user inputs and verified Boot File contents; no conflicts or hallucinations detected.

---------------- End-of-Session Topic -----------------
Titan Boot File Integration & End-of-Session Summary Protocol

---------------- Proposed Session Filename -------------
2025-11-23_titan-bootfile-integration-summary_rev1.txt

---------------- Main Themes Identified ----------------
1. Boot File Structure — Detailed discussion and preservation of original content.
2. Precision Mode Rules — Definition, default behavior, diagnostic overrides.
3. End-of-Session Summary — Templates, revisions, reliability assessment, display rules.
4. Session Reference Display — Post-confirmation output, filename and theme tracking.

---------------- Per-Topic Summaries -------------------
- Boot File Structure:
    The session confirmed the necessity of duplicating the original Boot File exactly before appending new modules or rules.
    All previous sections (metadata, activation phrases, virtues, modules) must remain unchanged.
    Decisions included keeping phase references optional and ensuring backward compatibility.
    Uncertainties about past content loss were addressed.
    Assumptions about user return sessions were noted but not enforced at this stage.

- Precision Mode Rules:
    Discussed Precision Mode operation, including default ON status, conditions for temporary internal PM-OFF during diagnostics, and requirement for automatic restoration to ON.
    Decisions include explicit recording if user overrides PM-OFF.
    Reliability assessment rules are embedded within PM guidelines.
    Assumptions include that all user-visible outputs remain PM-ON.

- End-of-Session Summary:
    Agreed on a structured summary template with header, main themes, per-topic summaries, consolidated session topic, proposed filename, and notes.
    Summaries are factual, concise (4–5 sentences per theme), and capture essence, decisions, uncertainties, and assumptions.
    Iterative summaries will increment revision numbers and reference previous summaries.
    Assumptions about filename formatting (lowercase, hyphens, no special characters) were clarified.

- Session Reference Display:
    Confirmed need for post-confirmation display with confirmed topic, proposed filename, and theme labels only.
    Revision number included.
    Fully displayed for copy/paste.
    Reliability of the display is fully verified; it mirrors the session summary and ensures traceability for future sessions.

---------------- Notes / Observations ------------------
- Session demonstrates full integration of Boot File with new End-of-Session rules.
- All outputs produced under Precision Mode ON.
- Future sessions can build on this summary (revision tracking enabled).

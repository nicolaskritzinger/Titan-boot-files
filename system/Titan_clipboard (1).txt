# ================= Titan Session Summary =================
# Date: 2025-11-23
# Main Theme: Precision Mode Redefinition and BootFile Revision
# =========================================================

### Topics and Summaries:

1. BootFile Review & Updates
- Reviewed the current Titan bootfile structure.
- Identified ambiguity in the top-line `Precision Mode: On/Off` metadata.
- Proposed moving it under `[Activation Phrases]` with default ON and a reference to the full definition.

2. Precision Mode Definition
- Defined Precision Mode as ensuring factual, coherent, structured outputs.
- Allowed reasonable inference and stylistic adjustments within factual boundaries.
- Clarified scope, exclusions, and effect for operational, predictive, and memory-handling tasks.

3. Precision Mode ON/OFF Rules
- ON: Summarization, tagging, memory reconciliation, rephrasing, contradiction reconciliation, controlled stylistic adjustments.
- OFF: Operational tasks (fetching/updating files), predictive/speculative tasks, exploratory/investigative diagnostics.
- Reinforced that Precision Mode governs reasoning and memory handling, not operations or free speculation.

4. Games & Iterative Definition
- Played question-based games to test boundaries and edge cases.
- Confirmed rules for inference, style, speculative tasks, and operational freedom.
- Clarified the distinction between factual reasoning and free/exploratory operations.

5. BootFile Layout Integration
- Incorporated updated Precision Mode definition and ON/OFF rules.
- Maintained full context and operational sequences.
- Ensured clean structure for easy reference and loader readability.

### Notes:
- Precision Mode now has a clear, boundary-aware definition.
- Bootfile is structured to separate metadata, activation, modules, sequences, and Precision Mode rules.
- Session ends with full guidance for future updates or revisions.

Topics and Summaries

- Titan Reset / Start from Scratch
  - Decided to start the Titan project over from a clean slate.
  - Discussed starting with minimal basics, focusing first on a Python script to save session summaries to GitHub.

- Python Script for GitHub Session Saving
  - Designed a minimal script to append a session summary to GitHub.
  - User preferred creating a new file for every session instead of appending.
  - Adjusted script to prompt for a title, prepend a date-stamp, and generate a unique file name.
  - Script accepts manual pasting of the session summary by the user.
  - GitHub token supplied and integrated into the script.

- Token Handling
  - Confirmed that Titan cannot automatically fetch tokens; user supplied the token manually.

- Goodbye Sequence Behavior
  - Reviewed Titan’s Goodbye Sequence.
  - Explained how it scans the session, generates a structured summary, presents it for confirmation, and waits before ending the session.
  - Optional integration with GitHub script for automatic saving discussed.

Notes
- Precision Mode: ON
- All summaries are explicit and respect the rules from the boot file.
- Nothing has been saved automatically to GitHub; user must run the Python script to store the summary.
